<h4>Frequently Asked Questions for Volunteer Managers</h4>
<p>Thanks for checking out Flash Volunteer. We wish we could wave our magic wands and make hundreds of eager volunteers appear at your door, but until our fairy godmother stops by, here is how you can make the most of the Flash Volunteer.</p>
<br/>
<p><h5>Q: What types of events work best for posting on Flash Volunteer?</h5>One-time events that require relatively untrained volunteers are the best. If you are looking for a long-term commitment from a single person (for example, a board member or mentor), we would recommend using our partner VolunteerMatch. If you’re holding an info session or training for potential volunteers, that could be a good fit for Flash Volunteer, though.</p>
<br/>
<p><h5>Q: Do I have to fill in all the fields to create an event? What if I don’t have an exact address?</h5>You are required to enter the event name, address, date and description. If your event doesn’t have a specific address, you can list the nearest intersection, then use the map to drag and drop your marker on the right spot.</p>
<br/><p><h5>Q: How do I know who is signed up?</h5>You will receive an email each time a volunteer signs up for your opportunity. You can also visit the event page and view the list of signups.</p>
<br/><p><h5>Q: How do I contact the volunteers who signed up for my event?</h5>On the event page, click Message Volunteers.</p>
<br/><p><h5>Q: What if something about my event has changed, or I need to cancel it?</h5>Make sure you update the event page. From there, you can edit the content or cancel the event. If you cancel the event, the volunteers who signed up will receive an email.  You can also send a message through Flash Volunteer by clicking on Message Volunteers from the event page.</p>
<br/><p><h5>Q: How do I check in with Flash Volunteer users at my event?</h5>You can print a sign-in sheet from your event page for your volunteers to confirm their attendance. (The sign-in sheet includes a QR code if they’d like to check in with the Flash Volunteer iPhone app.)</p>
<br/><p><h5>Q: Do I need to record volunteers’ participation on Flash Volunteer?</h5>We are honest people. We believe in our volunteers. That’s why volunteers are on the honor system to sign in to Flash Volunteer and confirm their hours worked.</p>
