			<h4>What is Flash Volunteer?</h4>
			<p>
				Flash Volunteer is a web-based engagement portal for volunteer service in Seattle. It allows users to find volunteer opportunities and create their own volunteer events to support causes in their neighborhoods. Flash Volunteer was built by volunteers, for volunteers, and we hope you will use it frequently.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_does_site_work_" class="hide">
			<h4>How does the site work?</h4>
			<p>
				After you create an account, Flash Volunteer allows you to manage all of your volunteer opportunities in one place. You can search for events, sign up for the ones you are interested in, and even create your own volunteer events to address needs that are important to you and your neighbors. We also allow you to track your hours volunteered, so you can get credit for service hours if you need them for school or work.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-where_fv_gets_events_" class="hide">
			<h4>Where does Flash Volunteer get its volunteer events?</h4>
			<p>
				From you! Individual users and local nonprofits post events on Flash Volunteer. We also share events from <%= link_to('All for Good', 'http://www.allforgood.org/')%>. (If you see an All for Good event on Flash Volunteer, you’ll also see a link to the original post, so you can let the event host know you are interested. Don’t forget to sign up on Flash, so that you can track your volunteer projects all in one place!) 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_to_search_events" class="hide">
			<h4>Can I search for events? What else can I search for?</h4>
			<p>
				We have a convenient search bar in the top right corner of every page. The best method is to search one keyword at a time. You can search for event titles, user names or email addresses, and organization names or email addresses. The search bar can also deliver frequently asked questions, like this one!  
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_to_create_events_" class="hide">
			<h4>So, I can really create my own volunteer event?</h4>
			<p>
				Yes, you can! Flash Volunteer was built to give individuals the tools they need to become more engaged with their neighbors. Just <%= link_to('create an event', '/events')%> and you are on your way!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-confirm_email_account_" class="hide">
			<h4>I just created an account, now I can't sign in or create an event. What's up?</h4>
			<p>
				Did you confirm your email address? When you signed in for the first time, you should have received a mail from us, asking you to confirm your email address. Once you click the confirmation link in that email, you should be good to go. You can <%= link_to 'resend the e-mail', new_user_confirmation_url %> if you deleted it. If you're still experiencing troubles, email us at <%= mail_to("info@flashvolunteer.org", "info@flashvolunteer.org", :subject => "I can't create an event", :encode=>"hex") %>, and we'll get on our team on it!

		</div>
		<div id="faq-props_" class="hide">
			<h4>What are "props"?</h4>
			<p>

		<div id="faq-what_about_flash_team_" class="hide">
			<h4>What's my Flash Team all about?</h4>
			<p>
				Your Flash Team is a way for you to stay connected to your neighbors, friends and fellow volunteers.

It's another way to help build community and strengthen ties between volunteers, neighbors and friends.

		<div id="faq-user_types_" class="hide">
			<h4>What types of users are there? Can I create an account for my organization?</h4>
			<p>
				There is just one type of user on Flash Volunteer – you! Each person has his or her individual account, and with it comes all the functionality of creating and signing up for events. If you represent an organization that holds events, you can create an organizational page. The page can create events and have multiple administrators. (This is similar to the way that Facebook pages are set up, if you’re familiar with that.) One user can also be an administrator on multiple pages. Kinda cool, huh?<!--and have multiple administrators-->
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-ton_of_info_" class="hide">
			<h4>Do you need a ton of information from me for me to sign up for an event?</h4>
			<p>
				If you are in a rush, you can do a quick event signup, where you only provide your name and email address. Later, when you have time, you should create your account so that you can take advantage of all the features that Flash has to offer! (Don’t worry, we’ll send you a reminder to do this.)
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-no_one_on_team_" class="hide">
			<h4>Why is there no one in my Flash Team? How do I find other Flash Volunteers?</h4>

		<div id="faq-un-sign_up_for_event_" class="hide">
			<h4>Uh oh. My plans changed. Can I un-sign up for an event?</h4>
